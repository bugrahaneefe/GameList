/// ``ListingKit`` comes with impression handling. When creating ``ListDataSource`` provide `true` for the `collectImpression` parameter.
/// ```swift
/// let dataSource = ListDataSource(collectImpression: true)

/// While user is scrolling the list if the cell is visible more than %50 then ``ListDataSource`` calls sections ``didHaveImpression(for:at:)`` method. If the cell already has impression event before ``ListDataSource`` won't call it again. So you don't need to keep track of which cell's impression event is sent.
